# SARS-CoV-2 spectra

Data used in [Mutational spectra distinguish SARS-CoV-2 replication niches](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509649v1)

# data directory

Each pathogen directory within this directory contains the input files used to calculate the SBS spectrum and the rescaled SBS spectrum

The sequence alignments have suffix .fasta, the rooted phylogenetic trees have suffix .nwk, the position conversion file is named conversion.txt, the reference is named reference.fasta and the SBS spectrum has suffix _SBS_spectrum.csv

The SARS-CoV-2 lineage spectra are in directory SARS-CoV-2, calculated from sequences in GISAID EPI_SET ID EPI_SET_220926yt, doi [https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.220926yt](https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.220926yt)

# figures directory

This directory contains data and scripts used in figures. Directories contain individual READMEs with details
